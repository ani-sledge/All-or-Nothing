Meeting with Jeff    

TODO
- Add in a 'Stepper' or progress bar, describing how to get started, and what to do each round, and what has already been done. Provide a way for people to get rid of it if it annoys them, and make sure it doesn't get in the way
- Material Design

- lightweight QUnit testing
- Switch the team and count inputs around in the navbar
- Mobile: instruction 'x' looks weird
- Mobile: navbar dropdowns are gray
- btn outline:0 
- create .ico
- checkbox for the dealer, allowing you to change the dealer but still tracking it
- select text is light grey on mobile, hard to see (I think this is fixed)
- All/Nothing checkbox not intuitive
- Reconsider scoring (equal Place for equal score)

---LAYOUT---
- checkbox for team game status 
- selector/dropdown for number of players
- remove 'next round' hover effect if total tricks hasn't been met $$$$

---GAME LOGIC---
PLAYER
- character limit on name fields? $$$$
- place bid checkbox directly under name
- based on #of players, slider should be as long as total tricks
- if team game, name placeholder is "Team Name"
- near slider, show what the round score would be based on the tricks taken, all or nothing check
- helpful error messages for form elements $$$$

- properties: name, tricks for round, score for round, bid
- actions: calculate round score, get properties, set properties

GAME
- prepopulate game with 4 players 
- end game when a score is <= 0, or finishes 10 rounds
- when game ends, have game over view
	- displays the player places

- if you try to create a new game during an active game
  (one of the player controls has been clicked/changed, or 
  even when the "game over" page is displayed), a confirm 
  will ask if you are sure (active status will end at the game over page, need a new way to track this)
- if you try to change the team status, or number of players,
  a confirm will warn you that this will delete the current game

- total # of tricks:
	- 2, 3, 4 players: 10 tricks
	- 5, 6 players: 8 tricks
- if the sum of players tricks is not correct,
  give an error message, and don't let them continue
  to the next round

- Prev Round button 
	- decrements the round counter
	- keeps the same scores, for now
	- could store previous score, and replace it in future $$$$

- track the current dealer (circles % starting at player 0)
- ability to change the dealer at the beginning of the game? $$$$

- properties: players list, round counter, active? state, team? status total tricks per round, current dealer
- actions: display players, increment round counter, decrement round counter, set active? state, 
  set total tricks per round, track current dealer, generate new game, set team? status, set # of players,
  display game over view, calculate player places

SCORE
- team games: all is only worth 50 pts

--OTHER--
feature detection? (for javascript being disabled) $$$$
brand icon links to homepage $$$$
footer links to various related websites, about page, ect. $$$$
Semantic markup $$$$
SEO $$$$
